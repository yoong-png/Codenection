# About The Track

### **Campus Safety App :** <br/>
(Mobile Application) <br/>
<br/>
### **Background :** <br/>
Campus safety has always been a concern for faculty, staff and especially for students walking alone or late at night. The vulnerability increases during evening hours, isolated campus areas, and emergency situations where immediate help may not be readily available. <br/>
<br/>
### **The problem :** <br/>
Current safety infrastructure often lacks comprehensive coverage, real-time responsiveness, and accessibility features that address the diverse needs of the campus community, leaving gaps in protection and support. <br/>
<br/>
### **What the solution should solve :** <br/>
Build a one stop campus safety mobile application that helps students and staff create a safe study space that is responsive and meets the diverse needs of a campus community by ensuring the app is accessible to all. <br/>




# Brief Introdcution to our Project / Documentation
### AR Fire Evacuation <br/>
AR is used to detect the place you are at and provide you with the fastest route out of danger during emergencies <br/>
<br/>
### AI Image Recognition <br/>
AI is used for image recognition to check for bullying, vandalism, harassment through cctv’s
Furthermore, it is also used for smoke or fire detection on campus from cctv’s, with the help of the AI itll provide push notification for all students in the campus/ from that campus <br/>
<br/>
### Live Location (Hazard Alert) <br/>
Live Location acts as a map for you to walk around campus or places nearby campus but here’s the catch
It comes with a report button that can share your location to our Admins providing them with your location when you feel unsafe around campus which will then cooperate with AI image recognition and cctv’s to check the area near that location <br/>
<br/>
### Safe Buddy Walk  <br/>
When its late at night or when you’re walking alone, no harm for an extra company to walk you to your destination
It has a similar design as a dating app hut used for finding buddies as a walk partner <br/>
<br/>
### Smart Parking Alerts <br/>
When your location enters the parking or is nearby
AI will detect the parkings left in a certain zone and inform you with the best parking zone and the number of parking left in that zone
This can allow you to park in areas that is safer
For example, nearer to staircase or lift that can bring convenience when it will be late soon, at areas that have strong bright lights or areas that still have parking <br/>
<br/>
### Admin CCTV <br/>
The admin’s will have access of all CCTV’s and the full map while also having the ability to cross check everything 
The map for the admin is updated with all the reports students or previous incidents that have occured with different colours linking to whether the cases were solved or not
The role for the admin is to update the system from time to time with important information like which zone light is under maintenance or which parking zone is dangerous. They would also need to double check cctv’s when there is smoke detected before push notification to avoid false alarms. They can also work with the AI providing extra safety to students.
