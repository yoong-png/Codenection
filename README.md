# About The Track

### **Campus Safety App :** <br/>
(Mobile Application) <br/>
<br/>
### **Background :** <br/>
Campus safety has always been a concern for faculty, staff and especially students walking alone or late at night. The vulnerability increases during evening hours, isolated campus areas, and emergency situations where immediate help may not be readily available. <br/>
<br/>
### **The problem :** <br/>
Current safety infrastructure often lacks comprehensive coverage, real-time responsiveness, and accessibility features that address the diverse needs of the campus community, leaving gaps in protection and support. <br/>
<br/>
### **Problem statement :** <br/>
Build a one stop campus safety mobile application that helps students and staff create a safe study space that is responsive and meets the diverse needs of a campus community by ensuring the app is accessible to all. <br/>

# Brief Introdcution to our Project / Documentation
### AR Evacuation <br/>
Hold up your phone, identify your current location, and provide an AR overlay for the fastest exit route during emergencies <br/>
<br/>
### AI Image Recognition <br/>
Checks for bullying, vandalism, harassment, safety hazards through CCTV. Furthermore, it is also used for smoke or fire detection. It will provide push notifications for all students on campus. <br/>
<br/>
### Live Location (Hazard Alert) <br/>
Live Location acts as a map for you to walk around campus or places nearby campus. The Report button shares your location with admins, providing them with your location when you feel unsafe around campus, which then cooperates with AI image recognition and CCTV. Additionally, it allows hazard reporting. <br/>
<br/>
### Buddy Walk  <br/>
When it's late at night or when you’re walking alone, no harm searching for extra company to walk you to your destination. It matchmakes you to a walking partner based on your gender and location, and only allows students or staff (security). <br/>
<br/>
### Parking Assistance <br/>
When your phone enters the parking  gates or is nearby, AI will detect slot availability and inform you of the best parking zone and slots available. This allows you to park in areas that is safer. For example, nearer to staircases or lifts for convenience, or areas that have bright lighting. <br/>
<br/>
### Anonymous Reporting System <br/>
Reporting system for issues like harassment, bullying, unfair treatment, or student life issues faced on campus. This system is for students to report their issues faced in school with or without locations, time and etc. It has the choice of reporting anonymously or not. However this will still be read by someone, hence inappropriate reports will be ignored. <br/>
<br/>
### Admin CCTV <br/>
The admins will have access to all CCTV’s and the full map while also having the ability to cross-check everything. The map for the admin is updated with all the reports students or previous incidents that have occurred, with different colours linking to whether the cases were solved or not. The role for the admin is to update the system from time to time with important information like which zone light is under maintenance or which parking zone is dangerous. They would also need to double check CCTVs when there is smoke detected before sending push notification to avoid false alarms. They can also work with the AI providing extra safety to students.
