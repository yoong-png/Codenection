# About The Track

**Campus Safety App:**
(Mobile Application)

**Background:**
Campus safety has always been a concern for faculty, staff and especially for students walking alone or late at night. The vulnerability increases during evening hours, isolated campus areas, and emergency situations where immediate help may not be readily available. 

**The problem:**
Current safety infrastructure often lacks comprehensive coverage, real-time responsiveness, and accessibility features that address the diverse needs of the campus community, leaving gaps in protection and support.

**What the solution should solve:**
Build a one stop campus safety mobile application that helps students and staff create a safe study space that is responsive and meets the diverse needs of a campus community by ensuring the app is accessible to all.

**Examples of features:**
It should offer features that help monitor, track and alert relevant authorities, such as but not limited to: an emergency button in case of emergencies, end-to-end location tracking, alerting friends, public safety dispatch and a reporting system to tip off campus security of any suspicious behaviours. Additionally, you may implement camera-based features such as environmental detection using models to identify surroundings and provide accessibility support through text-to-speech functionality.
